## Using GitHub

A GitHub repository is a central storage space to save all the files associated with a set of documentation, and where all of the versions of those files can be accessed. Each set of documentation will be added to its own GitHub repository, which will be leveraged by the [docs-build](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/docs-build) repository to create the website.

To add and manage files in a GitHub repository, become familiar with the principles of version control and Git. Here are some helpful outside resources to get started:
