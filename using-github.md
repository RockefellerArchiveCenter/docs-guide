## Using GitHub

A GitHub repository is a central storage space to save all the files associated with a set of documentation, and where all of the versions of those files can be accessed. Each set of documentation will be added to its own GitHub repository, which will be leveraged by the[ ](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/docs-theme)[docs-build](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/docs-build) repository to create the docs.rockarch.org site and enable us to separate public and private documentation.

To add and manage files in a GitHub repository, become familiar with the principles of version control and Git. Here are some helpful outside resources to get started:

## Get Started with GitHub

To work with GitHub:

1. Create or have an existing GitHub account. Sign up[ here](https://github.com/).

2. Send the username to a member of the Digital Programs Team to add the new user as a member to the[ RAC GitHub](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter) Organization.

3. Work with GitHub in one of three ways: directly in the browser, locally using GitHub Desktop, or from the command line:

* [Guide to using GitHub in the browser](https://pixelpioneers.co/blog/2017/using-github-without-the-command-line)

* [Install GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop/) to work with GitHub from a user interface on a computer desktop.

* [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/) to work from the command line

## Create a Repo

[Create a Repo Instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) from GitHub.

1. Designate the owner as the Rockefeller Archive Center.

2. Format the name using lowercase letters and dashes between words "short-name" (e.g. processing-manual).

3. Add a short description of the documentation.

4. Choose to make the repo public or private based on its pre-approved designation (see the* Rockefeller Archive Center Documentation Site Content Approval Policy*). The designation must be approved by the RAC Assistant Director for the relevant function area, and documentation that is made publicly available must also be approved by the Director of Archives.

5. Add a README file as specified above (See [GitHub README](#github-readme)).

6. Add a License as specified above (See [Licensing] (#licensing)).
