## Markdown Basics

Markdown is a lightweight Markup language. A Markup language is an annotation system for text that makes that text machine-readable. Markdown is designed to be easy to read, write, and edit using a limited set of punctuation characters to annotate the text. It is a plain text format; it does not specify color, font, or other style elements. docs.rockarch.org requires that documentation be created in or converted to Markdown. This contributes to documentation portability, intentional and consistent formatting for web content, and easy conversion to HTML and other formats.
