## Add New Content to the Development Site

To get started, create a new RAC GitHub repository for the documentation if one does not exist using the [docs-template](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/docs-template) repository template.
See the [Create a Repo Instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) from GitHub.

1. Choose a template: use `RockefellerArchiveCenter/docs-template`.
2. Designate the owner as the Rockefeller Archive Center.
3. Format the name using lowercase letters and dashes between words "short-name" (e.g. processing-manual).
4. Add a short description of the documentation.
5. Choose to make the repo public or private based on its pre-approved designation (see the [Rockefeller Archive Center Documentation Site Content Approval Policy](http://docs.rockarch.org/docs-policy/)).
6. Using the template will add all the [required files](#required-files) that can now be edited in the new repository as necessary.
7. Create a branch called `development` in the target repository.
8. Edit the template files and add any new content to the `development` branch using short, descriptive commit messages that describe the changes like "add config values," "fix typo," or "change template text". Use this descriptive commit message instead of the default "update [file]" message provided in GitHub.
9.  When you are ready to preview the documentation on the [development site](https://docs-internal.dev.rockarch.org/), ask a member of the Docs Team to add the documentation to the [docs-build repositories.yml](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/docs-build/blob/base/repositories.yml). If the documentation is not approved for the public site, it will be added only under the `private` list in the `repositories.yml` file. If it is approved to be public, it will be added under both the `private` and `public` list. Documentation should be added to the `repositories.yml` file as `RockefellerArchiveCenter/(name of the documentation)`.

## Review and Add Content to the Production Site
1. Preview the documentation on the [RAC development site](https://docs-internal.dev.rockarch.org/). A new commit to the `development` branch in GitHub will trigger the development site to update.
2. To get content on the production site, submit a pull request to merge `development` to the `base` branch of the GitHub repo.
3. For technical review of configurations or Markdown, request a member of the Docs Team to review the pull request.
4.  As per the [Content Approval Policy](https://docs.rockarch.org/docs-policy/), the relevant Assistant Director and Program Director should review public documentation in the format they prefer.
5.  Once a pull request is approved, merge the `development` branch into the `base` branch. The merge action will trigger the production site to add the new documentation to [docs.rockarch.org](https://docs.rockarch.org) for public access, or [docs-internal.rockarch.org](https://docs-internal.rockarch.org) for internal-only access.

## Required Files
The template repository already includes these files, which can be edited as necessary for a particular set of documentation.

* `index.md`
* `README.md`
* `LICENSE.md`
* `_config.yml`
* `/.github/workflows/publish_sns.yml`

### index.md

Documentation will be created in or converted to the Markdown format (see [Using Markdown](/docs-guide/using-markdown)) to be leveraged by Jekyll to build the website. Add simple documentation like a short policy or one-page informational sheet to the GitHub repository as a single Markdown file (named `index.md`). For multi-page documentation, see the [Multiple Documentation Files](#multiple documentation-files) section below.

#### Page Title and Layout

At the beginning of `index.md` and all Markdown files that are part of the documentation, include a title and the type of layout. This is the title that will be displayed as the title of the webpage.

```
---
layout: docs
title:  "Guide to Processing Collections"
---
```

**Note: the title of the page is the header 1. The headings in the Markdown should always start with heading level 2 (`##`). The level 2 headings will also be used to build the table of contents on the website so improve user navigation.**

#### Acknowledgements

Any institution or otherâ€™s work that we relied on in drafting our own documentation should be credited on the `index.md` page.

### Readme

Every GitHub repository requires a `README.md` file that includes information about what is in the repo, how to access and use the content, and defines documentation authorship. The README is formatted in Markdown and include a link to docs.rockarch.org.

### License

All RAC documentation that is shared publicly on this platform will be made available under a [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (CC0) public domain dedication, and all project-associated code is made available on the RAC organizational GitHub under an [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). For public content, choose a CC0 License for the GitHub repository. Do not include a license for private content.

The template repository already includes the CC0 License, but if the content is private (for internal RAC staff use only), remove `LICENSE.md` and the reference to it in `README.md`.

###  \_config.yml

This configuration file includes:
* Whether the documentation will be public or private. Designate this using `public: true` or `public: false`.
* Documentation title. The title should match the title in `index.md`.
* Associated tags
* Pages information that is used to create the side navigation table of contents for each set of documentation.

For guidance and an example of how to fill this out, see the ["Documentation Repository Configuration"](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/docs-build#documentation-repository-configuration) section of the docs-build README.

### publish_sns.yml
In order to deliver update notifications to Amazon SNS (which will trigger a build of the site), a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/docs-build#github-action-configuration) file named `publish_sns.yml` needs to be created in the `.github/workflows/` directory. The template repository already includes this file.

## Multiple Documentation Files

More complicated documentation might be more appropriately split into multiple files, which will translate into a corresponding number of web pages. In deciding how to divide the documentation, structure and present the content in a way that enhances navigation and use.

For example, in addition to an `index.md` file, the [Rockefeller Archive Center Guide to Processing Collections](http://docs.rockarch.org/processing_manual/) includes two other Markdown files that represent two different pages on docs.rockarch.org: Planning and Processing. All files should be in the root directory (no subfolders). Filenames should be short with no special characters or spaces. Use a hyphen between words instead of spaces. The filename will be part of the url of the site, so simple and concise are best.
